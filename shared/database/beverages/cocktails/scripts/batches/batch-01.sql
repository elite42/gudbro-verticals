After Prohibition and the rise of \"girly drink\" stigma, the cocktail fell out of favor, unfairly dismissed as too feminine. It was rediscovered in the craft cocktail renaissance of the 2000s and is now rightfully celebrated as a sophisticated classic."},"named_after":{"en":"Named after the Clover Club, an exclusive Philadelphia gentlemen''s club that met at the Bellevue-Stratford Hotel from the 1880s to 1920s."}}'::jsonb, '{"profile":["fruity","sour","dry","refreshing"],"description":{"en":"Bright and refreshing with a silky texture from the egg white.
