### Decisions

Full history in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.

Recent decisions affecting v1.1 work:

- v1.1: Accommodations chosen as first vertical with real backend (strategic node, distributes to other verticals)
- v1.1: Reuse existing conventions system (migration 050) for local partnerships instead of creating new tables
- v1.1: Start phase numbering at 4 (continuous from v1.0 Phase 3)

### Known Issues

**Tech debt from v1.0 (7 items):**

- Tours soups DB type errors (excluded from tsconfig)
- Visual QA on physical devices not performed
- Tours uses Tailwind instead of CSS variables
- Wellness /staff/[slug] lacks explicit back link
- 19 ESLint warnings in Wellness
- 3 placeholder links (href="#") in Tours/Workshops
- No manual smoke testing performed

### Pending Todos
