<objective>
Verify all 8 verticals meet UI/UX consistency criteria after Plans 02-01 and 02-02 fixes.

Purpose: Plans 02-01 and 02-02 fixed the only two verticals with actual problems (Wellness brand color + /gym routes, Accommodations missing BottomNav). Research confirmed the other 6 verticals already meet criteria. This plan runs automated verification across ALL 8 verticals to confirm phase-wide consistency and close the requirement coverage gap.

Output: Verification results confirming all 8 verticals pass UX-01 through UX-06 criteria. No code changes expected.

  <name>Task 1: Audit all 8 verticals for UI/UX consistency criteria</name>
  <files></files>
  <action>
  Run automated checks across all 8 vertical PWAs. No code changes — verification only.

**Check 1: BottomNav existence (UX-01, UX-02)**
Verify each vertical has a BottomNav component or inline nav:

- `ls apps/coffeeshop/frontend/components/v2/BottomNav.tsx` (Coffeeshop v2 pattern)
- `ls apps/gym/frontend/components/BottomNav.tsx` (Template pattern)
- `ls apps/wellness/frontend/components/BottomNav.tsx` (Template pattern)
- `ls apps/laundry/frontend/components/BottomNav.tsx` (Template pattern)
- `ls apps/pharmacy/frontend/components/BottomNav.tsx` (Template pattern)
- `ls apps/workshops/frontend/components/BottomNav.tsx` (Template pattern)
- `ls apps/accommodations/frontend/components/BottomNav.tsx` (Created in 02-02)
- `ls apps/tours/frontend/app/page.tsx` (Tours has inline bento nav — acceptable exception, 1 page only)

**Check 2: Brand color via CSS variable (UX-04)**
For each BottomNav file, verify active state uses a CSS variable (not hardcoded hex):

- Grep for `var(--` in each BottomNav file — should find color references
- Grep for hardcoded hex patterns like `#[0-9a-fA-F]{6}` used as active color — should find NONE in color assignments
- Tours exception: uses `text-amber-500` Tailwind class (acceptable — bento pattern, single page)

**Check 3: Safe area padding (UX-05)**
For each BottomNav, verify pb-safe or equivalent:

- Grep for `pb-safe` OR `safe-area-inset-bottom` in each BottomNav file
- Coffeeshop v2 uses inline `paddingBottom: 'var(--safe-area-bottom)'` — acceptable
- Tours uses `pb-safe-bottom` — acceptable

**Check 4: No cross-vertical routes (UX-06)**

- `grep -r '/gym' apps/wellness/frontend/app/` — should return nothing (fixed in 02-01)
- `grep -r '/coffeeshop\|/wellness\|/tours\|/laundry\|/pharmacy\|/workshops' apps/gym/frontend/app/` — should return nothing
- Spot-check 2-3 other verticals for cross-references

**Check 5: Header consistency (UX-03)**
Spot-check that each vertical's main page has a header section:

- Grep for common header patterns (h1, header, title section) in each vertical's page.tsx
- This is a structural check — headers don't need to be identical, just present and consistent within each vertical

**Results:**
Document all check results in the SUMMARY. If any check FAILS (unexpected), flag it for a gap closure plan. Based on research, all checks should PASS.
</action>
<verify>
All 8 verticals have BottomNav files (or inline nav for Tours).
No hardcoded hex colors in BottomNav active states (except Tours Tailwind exception).
All BottomNavs have safe area padding.
No cross-vertical route references found.
Headers present in all verticals.
</verify>
<done>All 8 verticals verified as meeting UX-01 through UX-06 criteria. Phase 2 success criteria confirmed across full scope.</done>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
1. BottomNav file exists for all 8 verticals (component or inline)
2. CSS variables used for brand colors in all BottomNavs
3. Safe area padding present in all BottomNavs
4. Zero cross-vertical route references
5. Headers present in all vertical main pages
</verification>

<success_criteria>

- All 8 verticals pass all 5 verification checks
- Any failures documented and escalated (not expected based on research)
- Phase 2 scope fully covered: fixes (02-01, 02-02) + verification (02-03)
  </success_criteria>
