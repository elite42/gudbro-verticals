## The Problem

Restaurant operators face fragmented tools, manual processes, and zero data intelligence:

| Pain Point                 | Impact                                                    |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Paper menus**            | Outdated, costly reprints, no analytics                   |
| **Manual translations**    | Lost international revenue (30%+ tourists in key markets) |
| **Blind margins**          | 60% of restaurants don't know their true food cost        |
| **Staff management chaos** | High turnover, no performance data                        |
| **Fragmented operations**  | 5+ tools for orders, inventory, marketing                 |
