## v1.3 Requirements

**Core Value:** Enable merchants to submit feedback and receive updates, with AI-powered processing and internal team task management

### Feedback Submission

- [x] **FBSUB-02**: Merchant can attach a screenshot to feedback submission
- [x] **FBSUB-03**: Submission auto-captures context (vertical, module/page, merchant ID)
- [x] **FBSUB-04**: Merchant can write in any language (no language picker required)
- [x] **FBSUB-05**: Merchant can view list of own past submissions with current status

### AI Processing

- [x] **FBAI-01**: System auto-translates submission to English (storing original language + translated fields)
- [x] **FBAI-02**: System classifies submission by type, priority, and sentiment
- [x] **FBAI-03**: System extracts topic tags from submission content
- [x] **FBAI-04**: System detects similar existing tasks via tag overlap + trigram similarity
- [x] **FBAI-05**: System aggregates similar submissions into unified tasks with denormalized metrics

### Admin Kanban

- [x] **FBADM-01**: Admin can view kanban board with columns (New, Reviewing, In Progress, Done, Rejected)
- [x] **FBADM-02**: Admin can drag-and-drop tasks between columns
- [x] **FBADM-03**: Task cards display aggregated info (merchant count, languages, sentiment, priority)
- [x] **FBADM-04**: Admin can open task detail panel showing all linked submissions with original + translated text
- [x] **FBADM-05**: Moving task to Done/Rejected triggers merchant notifications for all linked submissions

### Notifications

- [x] **FBNOT-01**: Merchant receives in-app notification when submission is acknowledged
- [x] **FBNOT-02**: Merchant receives notification when linked task moves to In Progress, Done, or Rejected
- [x] **FBNOT-03**: Bell icon in global header shows unread notification count
- [x] **FBNOT-04**: Merchant can view and mark notifications as read

### Analytics

- [x] **FBAN-01**: Admin can view submission volume over time chart
- [x] **FBAN-02**: Admin can view breakdown by type and vertical
- [x] **FBAN-03**: Admin can view top requested features (by linked submission count)
- [x] **FBAN-04**: Admin can view average response time metrics

## Future Requirements (Deferred)

### Advanced AI

- **FBAI-F01**: Semantic clustering via embeddings (pgvector) for improved duplicate detection
- **FBAI-F02**: Cross-vertical pattern recognition (surface themes across verticals)
- **FBAI-F03**: Auto-generated weekly/monthly trend summaries via Trigger.dev

### Public Features

- **FBPUB-F01**: Public roadmap visible to merchants
- **FBPUB-F02**: Merchant voting on feature requests
- **FBPUB-F03**: Real-time chat between team and merchant

### Integrations

- **FBINT-F01**: GitHub issue sync (auto-create issues from tasks)
- **FBINT-F02**: Email notifications (in addition to in-app)
- **FBINT-F03**: NPS/CSAT survey integration

## Out of Scope

| Feature                         | Reason                                                                          |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Public roadmap / voting         | Creates entitlement, GUDBRO is early-stage — keep product direction team-driven |
| Real-time chat                  | Turns feedback into support desk, different problem space                       |
| GitHub integration              | Wait until dev workflow stabilizes                                              |
| NPS/CSAT surveys                | Different methodology, separate feature                                         |
| Multi-step wizards              | Friction kills submissions, keep single-page form                               |
| Merchant-to-merchant discussion | Out of scope, use existing WhatsApp channels                                    |
| Embeddings / pgvector           | Over-engineering for <1000 submissions, tag overlap + trigram sufficient for V1 |
