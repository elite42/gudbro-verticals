# End Session Protocol

Before ending a session or when context is filling up:

1. **Update Inventory**
   - Add any new features/files to `docs/inventory.md`
   - Mark status changes (pending → completed)

2. **Update Sprint File**
   - If working on a sprint, update `docs/sprints/current.md`
   - Move completed sprints to `docs/sprints/archive/`

3. **Summary for Next Session**
   - Write brief summary of what was accomplished
   - Note any pending tasks or blockers
   - Save to `docs/sprints/current.md` or create new file

4. **Commit Changes**
   - Commit documentation changes with message:
   - "docs: update inventory and sprint status"

This ensures next session starts with full context.
