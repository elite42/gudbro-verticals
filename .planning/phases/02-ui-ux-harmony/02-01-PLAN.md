<objective>
Fix Wellness PWA: remove legacy /gym routes and fix BottomNav brand color.

Purpose: Wellness currently has two issues: (1) legacy /gym routes that belong to the standalone Gym PWA, and (2) BottomNav active state uses hardcoded pink (#ec4899) instead of the wellness brand color (sage green). Both break UI/UX consistency.

Output: Clean wellness PWA with correct brand color and no cross-vertical route contamination.

  <name>Task 1: Fix Wellness BottomNav brand color</name>
  <files>apps/wellness/frontend/components/BottomNav.tsx</files>
  <action>
  In apps/wellness/frontend/components/BottomNav.tsx:

1. Replace the hardcoded pink active color `#ec4899` with `var(--sage-hex)` on line 84:
   - Change: `color: isActive ? '#ec4899' : '#9ca3af'`
   - To: `color: isActive ? 'var(--sage-hex)' : 'var(--charcoal-muted)'`

2. The center item ("Pacchetti") is currently treated as a regular Link with active state. This is fine - pharmacy and workshops do the same. But ensure the center active color also uses `var(--sage-hex)` instead of any hardcoded color. (Currently center items use the same isActive logic, so this should be covered by step 1.)

3. Verify the BottomNav already has `pb-safe` class on the nav element (it does at line 69).

Do NOT change the inline SVG icons to Phosphor (out of scope for this QA milestone).
Do NOT change the nav item labels or routes.
</action>
<verify>
Grep for '#ec4899' in the file - should return zero matches.
Grep for 'var(--sage-hex)' - should return matches for active state color.
Grep for '#9ca3af' - should return zero matches (replaced with var(--charcoal-muted)).
</verify>
<done>Wellness BottomNav active state uses var(--sage-hex) brand color, inactive uses var(--charcoal-muted). No hardcoded hex colors for active/inactive states.</done>

  1. Delete the entire directory `apps/wellness/frontend/app/gym/` (contains page.tsx and [slug]/page.tsx). Use `rm -rf`.

2. In `apps/wellness/frontend/app/page.tsx`, remove all references to /gym:
   - Line 30: Remove the gym category object `{ id: 'gym', label: 'Gym', icon: '...', color: '#E06040' }` from the categories array
   - Lines 498-506: Remove the conditional block that renders a Link to "/gym" when `cat.id === 'gym'`
   - Lines 777+: Remove the Link to "/gym" in the "Gym & Fitness" section near the bottom of the page
   - If there is a "Gym & Fitness" section/card that only links to /gym, remove the entire section

Be careful:

- Do NOT remove other categories or sections
- Do NOT break the JSX structure - ensure proper closing tags after removal
- The categories array filtering may need cleanup if gym was referenced elsewhere
