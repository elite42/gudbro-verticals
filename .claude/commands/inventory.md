# Check Inventory

Before exploring the codebase or implementing any feature, read the inventory file:

1. Read `docs/inventory.md` to see all existing features
2. Check if the requested feature already exists
3. If it exists, report the file path and suggest modifications
4. If it doesn't exist, proceed with implementation

This prevents "rediscovery" of existing code.
