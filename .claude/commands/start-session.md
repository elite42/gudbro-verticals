# Start Session Protocol

When starting a new coding session:

1. **Read Inventory First**
   - Read `docs/inventory.md` for full feature list
   - Read `docs/sprints/current.md` for active sprint (if exists)

2. **Check Context**
   - What was the last task completed?
   - Are there pending items from previous session?

3. **Clarify Goals**
   - Ask user: "What would you like to work on today?"
   - Cross-reference with inventory to avoid duplicates

4. **Set Up TodoWrite**
   - Create todo list for the session
   - Mark items as completed as you go

This ensures continuity between sessions.
