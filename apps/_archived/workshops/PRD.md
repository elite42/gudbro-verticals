## 1. Vision & Objective

### Vision

Become the definitive digital marketplace for authentic, hands-on cultural workshops and experiences in Central Vietnam -- empowering small artisan operators to reach international tourists while preserving and celebrating traditional Vietnamese craftsmanship.

### Objective

Launch a PWA for the Da Nang / Hoi An corridor that:

1. **Surfaces hidden gems** -- connects tourists with small, independent workshop operators who have zero digital presence today (80%+ of the market)
2. **Removes friction** -- eliminates the language barrier, opaque scheduling, and trust gap that prevent tourists from booking artisan experiences
3. **Preserves culture** -- creates sustainable income for traditional craftspeople (lantern makers, silk weavers, potters) so their skills survive the next generation
4. **Charges the lowest commission in the market** -- 10-15% vs 20-30% on Viator/GetYourGuide/Klook, meaning operators keep 85-90% of revenue
5. **Integrates into the GUDBRO ecosystem** -- plugs workshops alongside accommodations, tours, wellness, laundry, and coffeeshop verticals

### Value Proposition

## 2. Market Context & Opportunity

### 2.1 Vietnam: The Most Affordable Workshop Destination in SEA

Vietnam -- and specifically the Hoi An / Da Nang corridor -- is the **workshop capital of Southeast Asia**. Hoi An alone has hundreds of artisan workshops spanning cooking, lanterns, pottery, silk, tailoring, and more. Vietnam is consistently **40-60% cheaper** than Bali and Chiang Mai for equivalent experiences.

| Workshop Type                  | Vietnam Price Range | Bali Price Range | Chiang Mai Price Range | Vietnam Advantage |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------- | ---------------- | ---------------------- | ----------------- |
| **Cooking class**              | $8 - $59            | $30 - $65        | $25 - $55              | 40-50% cheaper    |
| **Crafts (pottery, lanterns)** | $15 - $40           | $25 - $60        | $20 - $45              | 40-50% cheaper    |
| **Art & painting**             | $20 - $50           | $30 - $70        | $25 - $55              | 35-45% cheaper    |
| **Jewelry making**             | $30 - $60           | $35 - $80        | $30 - $60              | 20-40% cheaper    |
| **Bamboo craft**               | $15 - $35           | $20 - $45        | $15 - $35              | 25-40% cheaper    |
| **Martial arts (per session)** | $10 - $30           | $20 - $50        | $15 - $40              | 40-50% cheaper    |
| **Traditional dance**          | $15 - $30           | $20 - $45        | $15 - $35              | 25-35% cheaper    |
| **Coffee experience**          | $10 - $25           | $15 - $40        | $12 - $30              | 30-40% cheaper    |

| **Food tours**                 | $15 - $45           | $30 - $75        | $20 - $50              | 40-55% cheaper    |

### 2.2 The Problem: 80%+ Operators Are Digitally Invisible

| Problem                       | Impact                                                                                                                     |
| ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **No digital presence**       | 80%+ of workshop operators are SMEs with no website, no booking system, just a physical location and maybe a Facebook page |
| **Language barrier**          | Operators speak limited English; tourists cannot understand offerings, schedules, inclusions, or skill requirements        |
| **Discovery gap**             | Tourists rely on hotel concierge, TripAdvisor reviews (no booking), or random walk-ins -- missing dozens of options        |
| **No real-time availability** | Tourists walk to a workshop only to find it's full, closed today, or the English-speaking instructor is off                |
| **Trust deficit**             | No verified reviews, no portfolio, no way to evaluate quality before committing time and money                             |
| **Booking friction**          | No online booking; must call, message on Facebook, or physically show up                                                   |
| **Payment limitations**       | Cash only in most cases; no way to hold a spot or prepay                                                                   |

### 2.3 Operator Landscape

Workshops in Da Nang / Hoi An are run by diverse types of operators:

| Operator Type                          | Examples                                                       | Characteristics                                                         |
| -------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Independent artisans / families**    | Lantern makers in Hoi An Old Town, pottery in Thanh Ha village | Multi-generational skills, zero digital presence, Vietnamese only       |
| **Cooking schools**                    | Red Bridge Cooking School, Green Bamboo Cooking Class          | Some digital presence, higher prices, English-speaking, already on OTAs |
| **International instructors (expats)** | Yoga teachers, art workshop leaders, photography walks         | Tech-savvy, English-native, price-sensitive on commission               |
| **Resort / hotel in-house**            | Hotel cooking classes, on-site massage + craft workshops       | Captive audience but limited to hotel guests                            |
| **Craft cooperatives**                 | Silk weaving co-ops, community-based tourism initiatives       | Government-linked, multiple artisans, variable quality                  |

### 2.4 Market Numbers

| **Klook**                 | Asian activities            | 15-25%           | Strong Asian market traffic                                                                     | Standardized experiences; less authentic/artisan feel                              |
| **Cookly**                | Cooking classes only        | 15-20%           | Niche cooking focus, good UX                                                                    | **Cooking only** -- no crafts, no lanterns, no pottery, no silk                    |
| **Facebook / Instagram**  | Organic social              | 0%               | Free, visual                                                                                    | No booking, no availability, no structured reviews                                 |

| **GUDBRO Workshops**      | Vietnam artisan experiences | **10-15%**       | **Lowest commission, local-first, ecosystem integration, multi-language, WhatsApp/Zalo native** | New entrant, needs to build supply                                                 |

**GUDBRO's five competitive advantages:**

2. **Ecosystem integration** -- cross-sell from GUDBRO Stays, Tours, Wellness, Coffeeshop, Laundry
3. **Local-first design** -- built for Vietnam's small operators, not adapted from a global template
4. **Multi-vertical referral network** -- hotels earn 10% for recommending workshops to guests
5. **WhatsApp/Zalo native booking** -- operators use tools they already know (no new software to learn)

## 3. User Personas

### Persona 1: Experience-Seeking Tourist -- "Sophie"

- **Demographics:** 26-38, European or Australian, traveling solo or as a couple
- **Context:** Visiting Hoi An for 3-5 days, wants to "do something local," has seen lantern-making photos on Instagram
- **Budget:** $15-50 per workshop, willing to spend more for unique experiences
- **Pain points:**
  - Googles "Hoi An workshops" and gets Viator results that all look the same (cookie-cutter cooking classes)
  - Walks down the street and sees 10 workshops but cannot compare them (pricing, quality, reviews, what's included)
  - Language barrier: cannot ask detailed questions about what's included, how long it takes, skill level required
  - No way to verify quality before committing -- no portfolio of past work, no verified reviews
- **Behavior:** Discovers GUDBRO via QR code at her accommodation, Google search, or friend's shared link. Browses the catalog on her phone, filters by "lantern making" + "English speaking" + "Hoi An Old Town," reads reviews, views photo gallery of past participants' creations, and sends a WhatsApp booking request
- **Goal:** Find an authentic, well-reviewed workshop and book it without hassle. Take home something she made with her own hands
- **Success metric:** Books within one browsing session; leaves a 5-star review with photos

### Persona 2: Digital Nomad / Long-Term Expat -- "Marcus"

- **Demographics:** 28-42, international (any nationality), working remotely from Da Nang or Hoi An
- **Context:** Has been in Vietnam for 2-6 months. Already done the tourist highlights. Looking for deeper cultural immersion and social activities to break the remote-work routine
- **Budget:** $10-30 per session (recurring), price-sensitive on repeated activities
- **Pain points:**
  - Tourist-oriented workshops feel superficial -- he wants ongoing learning, not a one-off photo op
  - Hard to find martial arts classes (Vovinam), regular pottery sessions, or recurring art workshops
  - Wants to meet locals and other expats through shared experiences
  - Most listings cater to short-stay tourists, not repeat participants
- **Behavior:** Uses GUDBRO regularly. Bookmarks favorite operators. Filters by "multi-session" or "weekly" options. Tries different workshops each week -- pottery on Monday, Vovinam on Wednesday, coffee tasting on Saturday
- **Goal:** Build a weekly routine of cultural activities. Develop real skills (not just tourist-level). Find a community
- **Success metric:** Books 3+ workshops per month; becomes a repeat customer for specific operators

### Persona 3: Small Workshop Operator -- "Thanh"

- **Demographics:** 35-55, Vietnamese, runs a pottery workshop in Thanh Ha village (Hoi An) with 2-3 helpers
- **Context:** Has been making pottery for 20 years, learned from his father. Gets tourists from walk-ins and a few TripAdvisor reviews. No website. Uses Facebook sporadically. Speaks basic English
- **Monthly revenue:** Variable -- 2-5M VND ($80-200) on slow weeks, 8-15M VND ($320-600) in high season
- **Pain points:**
  - Income is unpredictable -- some days 15 tourists, some days zero
  - Cannot communicate with Korean/Chinese tourists at all (lost revenue)
  - Viator wants 25% commission and requires complex onboarding he cannot navigate
  - Does not know how to take online bookings or manage a digital calendar
  - Photos of his work are only on his personal Facebook -- not professional quality
- **Behavior:** GUDBRO team visits his workshop, takes professional photos, creates his profile in English/Vietnamese/Korean. He manages availability via a simple WhatsApp/Zalo-based system. Receives booking requests as pre-formatted messages he can confirm with one tap
- **Goal:** Get more tourists through the door with zero tech overhead. Keep most of his revenue. Reach Korean and Chinese tourists he currently misses entirely
- **Success metric:** 30%+ increase in monthly visitors within 3 months of listing

### Persona 4: GUDBRO Hotel Partner -- "Linh" (Hotel Manager)

- **Demographics:** 30-45, Vietnamese, manages a boutique hotel or homestay in Da Nang with 15-30 rooms
- **Context:** Her hotel is on GUDBRO Stays. Guests constantly ask "what should I do in Hoi An?" She currently recommends 2-3 workshops she personally knows, but the suggestions feel limited and she earns nothing from them
- **Revenue from GUDBRO Workshops:** Could earn 10% referral on every guest booking -- estimated $200-500/month at scale
- **Pain points:**
  - Cannot offer a wide variety of curated experiences to guests
  - Competing with Airbnb and Booking.com -- needs differentiation
  - No structured way to track referrals or earn from recommendations
  - Guests who have a great workshop experience leave better hotel reviews -- but she has no data on this
- **Behavior:** Adds the "Workshops & Experiences" card to her GUDBRO in-stay dashboard. When guests ask for recommendations, she points them to the GUDBRO workshops page (auto-filtered by proximity). Every booking through her property earns her 10%. She can see referral earnings in her GUDBRO dashboard
- **Goal:** Enhance guest experience, differentiate from OTA-only hotels, earn passive referral income
- **Success metric:** 20%+ of guests engage with workshops; $300+/month referral income within 6 months

### 5.3 Workshop Detail Page

A rich, immersive detail page giving tourists everything they need to decide.

**Sections:**

1. **Hero Gallery** -- 5-10 high-quality photos (workshop space, materials, process, finished products, happy participants)
2. **Quick Facts Bar** -- Price | Duration | Language | Group Size | Skill Level
3. **Description** -- What you will do, what you will learn, what you take home
4. **What's Included** -- Materials, tools, instructor, finished product, refreshments, certificate
5. **What to Bring** -- Comfortable clothes, camera, etc.

11. **Booking CTA** -- Sticky bottom bar with price and "Book via WhatsApp" / "Book via Zalo" button

### 5.4 Calendar / Availability View

- 14-day rolling calendar display
- Each day shows available time slots (e.g., "9:00 AM - 11:00 AM," "2:00 PM - 4:30 PM")
- Remaining capacity per slot (e.g., "4 spots left")
- Fully booked slots grayed out with "Full" label
- Operator updates availability via simple WhatsApp/Zalo command or basic admin panel

### 5.5 Booking via Messaging (WhatsApp / Zalo)

Phase 1 uses messaging apps that operators already know -- no full booking engine required.

**Flow:**

1. Tourist selects a date, time, and group size on the detail page
2. Taps "Book via WhatsApp" or "Book via Zalo"
3. A **pre-formatted message** opens in the messaging app:

```
Hi [Operator Name]! I'd like to book:

Workshop: [Workshop Name]
Date: [Selected Date]
Time: [Selected Time]
Guests: [Number]
Language: [Preferred Language]
Name: [Tourist Name]

Booked via GUDBRO Workshops
Ref: #GW-[booking-id]
```

4. Operator receives the message, confirms or suggests alternative
5. Tourist pays on arrival (cash or card if operator accepts)

**Why this works for Phase 1:**

- Zero tech overhead for operators (they already use WhatsApp/Zalo daily)
- No payment integration complexity
- Personal touch that tourists appreciate
- GUDBRO tracks booking requests via the reference ID for analytics

### 5.6 Reviews & Ratings System

## 7. Design System

### 7.1 Design Philosophy

The Workshops & Experiences vertical should feel **creative, warm, and inspiring** -- like stepping into an artisan's studio. The design celebrates **handmade craft, natural materials, and cultural authenticity**. It must feel distinctly different from the clinical, corporate look of Viator, GetYourGuide, and Klook.

**Core principles:**

1. **Artisanal warmth** -- Earth tones, natural textures, handcrafted feel
2. **Photography-forward** -- Large, warm-toned images of hands at work, materials, finished creations
3. **Mobile-first** -- 90%+ of tourists browse on phones
4. **Trust through transparency** -- Prices, reviews, and inclusions are immediately visible
5. **Cultural respect** -- Celebrate Vietnamese craft heritage, not exoticize it

### 7.2 Color Palette

```css
:root {
  /* Primary - Terracotta (warm, earthy, artisanal) */
  --terracotta: #c2703e;
  --terracotta-light: #e8a977;
  --terracotta-dark: #9b4d2b;

  /* Secondary - Amber Gold (highlights, badges, accents) */
  --amber: #d4a04a;
  --amber-light: #f5e6c4;
  --amber-dark: #b8872e;

  /* Background - Warm Cream & Ivory */
  --ivory: #faf7f2;
  --cream: #f5ede3;
  --sand: #ede0d0;

  /* Text */
  --clay: #8b5e3c; /* Headings, strong emphasis */
  --charcoal: #2d2a26; /* Body text */
  --charcoal-light: #5c5650; /* Secondary text */
  --charcoal-muted: #9b9590; /* Captions, placeholders */

  /* Accent - Sage Green (availability, success) */
  --sage: #7a8b6f;
  --sage-light: #d4dfd0;
  --sage-dark: #5a6b4f;

  /* Functional */
  --success: #7a8b6f; /* Same as sage */
  --error: #c44b4b;
  --warning: #d4a04a; /* Same as amber */
  --info: #6b8ca0;

  /* Category Accent Colors */
  --cat-cooking: #c2703e; /* Terracotta */
  --cat-craft: #8b7355; /* Warm brown */
  --cat-art: #9b6b8a; /* Muted plum */
  --cat-jewelry: #d4a04a; /* Amber gold */
  --cat-bamboo: #7a8b6f; /* Sage green */
  --cat-martial: #8b5e3c; /* Clay */
  --cat-dance: #c47a8a; /* Dusty rose */
  --cat-coffee: #6b5344; /* Dark brown */
  --cat-fashion: #b07aaa; /* Soft purple */
  --cat-food-tour: #c2703e; /* Terracotta */
}
```

**Rationale:** These earth tones evoke natural materials -- clay, wood, silk, dried herbs, terracotta pots -- the raw ingredients of Vietnam's artisan workshops. The palette avoids cold blues and sterile whites common on travel platforms.

### 7.3 Typography

```css
:root {
  /* Display / Headlines -- Serif for editorial, crafted quality */
  --font-display: 'DM Serif Display', Georgia, serif;

  /* Body / UI -- Clean sans-serif for readability */
  --font-body: 'DM Sans', system-ui, sans-serif;
}
```

| Element                  | Font             | Weight | Size (mobile) | Size (desktop) |
| ------------------------ | ---------------- | ------ | ------------- | -------------- |
| **H1 (Page title)**      | DM Serif Display | 400    | 28px          | 40px           |
| **H2 (Section heading)** | DM Serif Display | 400    | 22px          | 32px           |
| **H3 (Card title)**      | DM Sans          | 600    | 18px          | 24px           |
| **Body**                 | DM Sans          | 400    | 15px          | 16px           |
| **Caption / Label**      | DM Sans          | 500    | 12px          | 13px           |
| **Price**                | DM Sans          | 700    | 20px          | 24px           |
| **Badge text**           | DM Sans          | 600    | 11px          | 12px           |

The serif headline font gives the platform a crafted, editorial quality that differentiates it from generic booking platforms.

### 7.4 Visual Language

- **Photography:** Warm-toned, natural light, close-ups of hands working with materials. Show the process, not just the result. People smiling, concentrating, creating. Avoid stock photography -- all images taken by GUDBRO team on-site
- **Card design:** Rounded corners (12-16px), subtle warm shadow (`0 2px 8px rgba(45,42,38,0.08)`), cream background. No harsh borders
- **Badges:** Pill-shaped with amber gold background for categories, sage green for availability, terracotta for featured
- **Icons:** Phosphor Icons in duotone weight, terracotta color for primary actions
- **Maps:** Warm-toned map style (avoid default Google blue)
- **Empty states:** Optional hand-drawn style line art (craft tools, lanterns, pottery wheel)
- **Textures:** Very subtle paper/linen texture on backgrounds (optional, never distracting)

### 7.5 Component Sketches

## 11. Risks & Mitigations

| #   | Risk                                                                                               | Probability | Impact | Mitigation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| --- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------- | ------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | **Operator adoption resistance** -- artisans are not tech-savvy and may distrust digital platforms | High        | High   | GUDBRO team handles ALL setup. Zero tech required from operators. They just receive WhatsApp messages like they already do. Face-to-face onboarding in Vietnamese. Deliver first booking within 7 days to build trust                           |
| 2   | **Low booking conversion** -- tourists browse but do not book because WhatsApp feels informal      | Medium      | High   | Make the booking flow frictionless (pre-filled message, one tap). Show social proof (reviews, ratings, participant photos). Phase 2: add prepayment for commitment                                                                              |
| 3   | **Quality inconsistency** -- some workshops disappoint tourists, damaging the GUDBRO brand         | Medium      | High   | Vet every operator in person before listing. Minimum photo quality standards. Review system with rapid response to complaints. Remove operators below 3.5 stars after 10 reviews                                                                |
| 4   | **Seasonal demand volatility** -- tourism is seasonal, operators see no bookings in low season     | Medium      | Medium | Da Nang / Hoi An have warm weather year-round (milder than Bangkok/Bali). Promote to domestic tourists and expats during low season. Offer off-peak discounts                                                                                   |
| 5   | **Commission collection difficulty** -- operators may bypass GUDBRO after initial tourist contact  | Medium      | Medium | Track referral attribution via booking reference codes. Build value beyond lead-gen (reviews, SEO traffic, cross-vertical). Phase 3: prepayment where GUDBRO collects and distributes                                                           |
| 6   | **Visit Vietnam government platform** -- launching Q2 2026, could compete for same operators       | Low         | Medium | Move fast -- establish supply before government launch. Visit Vietnam will focus on large, formal operators -- GUDBRO targets the 80% of independents they won't serve. Different value prop: ecosystem + low commission vs. government listing |
| 7   | **Photo quality issues** -- operator-submitted photos are low quality                              | Medium      | Low    | Phase 1: GUDBRO team takes all photos. Phase 2: provide photo guidelines and review process.

### 12.2 Commission Structure

| Scenario                                                         | Operator | Referrer | GUDBRO | Total Commission |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- | -------- | ------ | ---------------- |
| **Direct booking** (tourist finds GUDBRO via Google, QR, social) | 85%      | 0%       | 15%    | 15%              |
| **Referred booking** (tourist from GUDBRO accommodation or tour) | 85%      | 10%      | 5%     | 15%              |
| **QR code at partner venue**                                     | 85%      | 10%      | 5%     | 15%              |

**Phase 1 (Months 1-6):** Commission is tracked but **not actively collected**. Focus on building supply and demand. Operators pay nothing. GUDBRO subsidizes growth.

**Phase 2 (Months 7-12):** Commission collection begins via:

- Prepayment system (GUDBRO collects, distributes minus commission)
- Monthly invoice for operators without prepayment

### 12.3 Commission Comparison vs Competitors

| Platform             | Operator Keeps | Commission | Notes                             |
| -------------------- | -------------- | ---------- | --------------------------------- |
| **GUDBRO**           | **85-90%**     | **10-15%** | Lowest in market                  |
| Cookly               | 80-85%         | 15-20%     | Cooking only                      |
| Airbnb Experiences   | 80%            | 20%        | Declining focus on experiences    |
| Klook                | 75-85%         | 15-25%     | Asian market focus                |
| GetYourGuide         | 75-80%         | 20-25%     | European traffic                  |
| Viator (TripAdvisor) | 70-80%         | 20-30%     | Highest commission, biggest reach |

### 12.4 Additional Revenue Streams (Phase 3+)

| ---------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| **Featured placement**       | Operators pay to appear at top of category/area pages           | $20-50/month per operator          |
| **Professional photography** | Paid photo shoot service for operators wanting premium listings | $50-100 per shoot                  |
| **Gift vouchers**            | GUDBRO sells workshop gift cards (margin on unredeemed)         | 5-10% margin on sales              |
| **Bundle packages**          | Multi-workshop packages at discount (higher total spend)        | Higher AOV, same commission %      |
| **Corporate events**         | Team-building workshop packages for companies/groups            | Premium pricing, 15-20% commission |

### 12.5 Unit Economics (Target at Month 12)

| Metric                                               | Value                        |

| Monthly net contribution                             | ~$4,200                      |
| Customer acquisition cost (CAC)                      | ~$2.00 (SEO-heavy, low paid) |
| Lifetime value (LTV) per tourist                     | ~$5.40 (1.5 bookings avg)    |
| LTV:CAC ratio                                        | 2.7:1                        |

### 12.6 Referral Economics for Hotels

A partner hotel with 20 rooms at 70% occupancy:

| Metric                      | Value                           |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Guests per month            | ~420 (20 rooms x 70% x 30 days) |
| Workshop engagement rate    | 15% (conservative)              |
| Bookings per month          | ~63                             |
| Average workshop price      | $30                             |

| **Monthly referral income** | **~$189**                       |
| Annual referral income      | ~$2,268                         |

At 25% engagement (achievable with in-stay dashboard prominence): **$315/month** passive income.

### 13.3 Shared Guest Context

When a tourist arrives from another GUDBRO vertical, we carry forward via URL parameters:

| Data Point          | Source                      | Passed Via                                |
| ------------------- | --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Language preference | Browser / previous vertical | `?lang=en`                                |
| Currency preference | Previous vertical selection | `?currency=USD`                           |
| Guest name          | Accommodation booking       | `?guest=Marcus`                           |
| Stay dates          | Accommodation booking       | `?checkin=2026-02-10&checkout=2026-02-15` |
| Location (lat/lng)  | Accommodation address       | `?lat=15.8801&lng=108.3380`               |
| Referrer type       | Source vertical             | `?ref=accommodation`                      |
| Referrer ID         | Source entity               | `?ref_id=beach-view-hotel`                |

This creates a seamless experience where switching between GUDBRO verticals feels like one unified platform, not separate apps.
